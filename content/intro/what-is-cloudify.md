Cloudify is an open source, TOSCA-based cloud orchestration framework that provides full lifecycle automation (provisioning, deployment, monitoring and remediation) of enterprise and NFV applications. Cloudify provides a single pane of glass across cloud platforms, containers and even non-virtualized and bare metal, while supporting your existing tools and install base.


# Application Orchestration

Your application in its entirety (infrastructure, middleware, application code, scripts, tool configuration, metrics and logs) can be described in a *Blueprint*.
Written in YAML format, a Blueprint enables a high granularity of configuration of your application.

You can define the enitre lifecycle of each part of your application in the Blueprint. Cloudify can deploy and manage your application, utilizing the tools of your choice.

Cloudify launches the compute instances, and configures network, storage and security in order to provide the required infrastructure resources for your application.
Then Cloudify executex scripts (remotely via SSH, or locally on the machines), or invokes configuration management tools to configure your servers and deploy your middleware and code.

# Application Maintenance

The custom Cloudify workflows make it simple to change your applicationâ€™s structure. Cloudify provides metrics and log collection capabilities to stream data to Cloudify so that you can act upon it.

Data aggregation and visualization within Cloudify enables you to execute the different workflows, so that either you or Cloudify itself can make actionable decisions based on business/application KPIs. Those decisions can either manually or automatically trigger workflows (such as scaling or healing) on the tactical front, or as application behavior analysis on the strategic front.


# Pluggability

Cloudify's plugins complete the framework.

Cloudify-specific plugins can run scripts, CM tools, metrics and logs aggregators, or any other tool for that matter.

A plugin is an abstraction below which a tool is installed, configured and executed. Plugins are written in Python which makes them rather easy to write.

For example, Cloudify's [Script Plugin]({{< relref "plugins/script.md" >}}) enables you to execute scripts at different times throughout the application's lifecycle (creation, configuration, stable state, etc.)

Another example would be the [Diamond plugin]({{< relref "plugins/diamond.md" >}}) which enables users to send back metrics after the application was deployed.

Users can write and deploy their own plugins and import them in their blueprints.

# Standardization

Cloudify's DSL (Domain Specific Language) is based on [TOSCA](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=tosca) (Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications) - an emerging standard led by Oasis.


# Open-Source

Cloudify comprises several open-source tools and our Python code which allows for easy composability.

The main open-source components behind Cloudify are:

* [Nginx](http://nginx.com/)
* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
* [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash)
* [RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/)
* [Riemann](http://riemann.io/)
* [InfluxDB](http://influxdb.com/)
* [Grafana](http://grafana.org/)
* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/)
* [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/)
* [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/)
* [Diamond](http://diamond.readthedocs.io/)
* [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/)

And many more...

Cloudify itself is open-source and accepts contributions.
