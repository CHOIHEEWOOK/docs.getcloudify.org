The Web UI includes hotkey shortcuts for performing all of the primary actions available in the UI, including navigating pages, uploading, deleting and deploying a Blueprint, executing a workflow, deleting and updating a deployment, and more.

You can click the `?` button to display a context-senstive list of the available hotkeys. For example, on the Blueprints page the following hotkeys are available.
