The Cloudify installation uploadsits Python artifacts to PyPi.You can install the latest release from PyPi by running the following commandsin a terminal:{{< gsHighlight bash >}}$ pip install cloudify{{< /gsHighlight >}}You can also request a specific version, using the following:{{< gsHighlight bash >}}$ pip install cloudify==3.3{{< /gsHighlight >}}PyPi contains the same [releases](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-cli/tags) as are available on GitHub, however the naming convention is different. For example, to get `3.3m6` you must request `cloudify==3.3a6`.The full list of PyPi versions is [available here](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloudify/json).## Installing from GitHubCloudify uses GitHub as its primary online source code repository.You can install the latest release from GitHub by running the following commands in a terminal:{{< gsHighlight bash >}}$ CFY_VERSION="4.0.0"$ pip install "https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-cli/archive/$CFY_VERSION.zip" \  --requirement "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-cli/$CFY_VERSION/dev-requirements.txt"{{< /gsHighlight >}}Installing latest bleeding edge release by running the following commands in a terminal:{{< gsHighlight bash >}}$ CFY_VERSION="master"$ pip install "https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-cli/archive/$CFY_VERSION.zip" \  --requirement "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-cli/$CFY_VERSION/dev-requirements.txt"{{< /gsHighlight >}}You can set the _`CFY_VERSION`_ variable to any required version in the [version list](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-cli/tags).
